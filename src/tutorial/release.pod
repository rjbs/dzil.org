=head1 Releasing Your Distribution

If you release your code to the CPAN, you probably want these three plugin in
your configuration:

  #!vim dosini
  [TestRelease]
  [ConfirmRelease]
  [UploadToCPAN]

With those plugins in place, the C<dzil release> command will:

=for :list
* L<build your distribution|@how-build-works>
* write a tarball to disk
* ensure that it can be extracted and successfully tested
* prompt you for one last confirmation
* upload the distribution to PAUSE (the Perl author upload server)

To let Dist::Zilla upload on your behalf, you'll want a F<~/.pause> file with
contents like this:

  user RJBS
  password PeasAreDelicious

Everything else will just work!

=head2 Trial Releases

Normally, when you run C<dzil release>, the distribution uploaded to the CPAN
is ready for indexing.  That means that it becomes the current, stable, indexed
source of all the packages it contains.  If someone tries to install
Your::Library, they'll start getting the one from the release you just made.

Sometimes, you want to upload a dist to the CPAN that can be found and
downloaded by interested people (or by automated testers running against the
bleading edge).  The solution is to make a I<trial release>.  This release will
look just like any other release, but it won't be indexed by PAUSE, so it won't
be automatically chosen as the latest available version by CPAN clients.

To make a trial release, just run:

  $ dzil release --trial
