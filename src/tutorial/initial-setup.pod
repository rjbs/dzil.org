=head1 Performing Initial Dist::Zilla Configuration

You can do a lot of things without ever configuring Dist::Zilla, but creating a
user configuration file up front can save you time later.  This file will live
at F<~/.dzil/config.ini>, and will provide information in "stashes" used to get
defaults for things like your username, your preferred license, and so on.
It's an L<INI file|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>, following the
L<grammar in Config::INI|https://metacpan.org/pod/Config::INI#GRAMMAR>.

Dist::Zilla can produce this file for you, if you run C<dzil setup>.  If you
prefer to do things the old fashioned way, here's a sample F<config.ini>
suitable for copying, pasting, and editing:

  #!vim dosini
  [%User]
  name  = E. Xavier Ample
  email = cpan@example.com

  [%Rights]
  license_class    = Perl_5
  copyright_holder = E. Xavier Ample

  [%PAUSE]
  username = EXAMPLE
  password = cakesandale

If you've already set up Dist::Zilla in the distant past, and your
configuration is no longer valid, you'll have to move this file out of the way.
You can't just call it F<config.ini.old>, because Dist::Zilla is cunning and
will think it's some kind of C<old>-format configuration.  Sorry.
