=head1 Building a Dist from Scratch

Starting a distribution with Dist::Zilla is easy.  It provides a system for
"minting" new distributions, much like `h2xs`, L<Module::Starter>, or other
similar tools.  Unlike those, it is I<extremely> customizable and can be made
to do I<much> more than just build a bunch of files for you to edit.

=head2 Install Dist::Zilla

For the tasks below, you'll want to:

=for :list
* install L<Dist::Zilla>, version 4.101780 or later
* run C<L<dzil setup|@initial-setup>>

The rest of this document assumes that you haven't made a custom minting
profile, meaning that you haven't got anything in F<~/.dzil/profiles>.  If you
do, and the behavior you see isn't what's described below, you might want to
move that directory out of the way, or read more about how minting profiles
work.

=head2 Run C<dzil new>

It's easy:

  $ dzil new Your::Library
  [DZ] making directory ./Your-Library
  [DZ] writing files to /Users/rjbs/tmp/Your-Library
  [DZ] dist minted in ./Your-Library

If you haven't set up any special minting configuration, you'll have two files.

F<./Your-Library/dist.ini>:

  #!vim dosini
  name    = Your-Library
  author  = E. Xavier Ample <example@cpan.org>
  license = Perl_5
  copyright_holder = E. Xavier Ample <example@cpan.org>
  copyright_year   = 2010

F<./Your-Library/lib/Your/Library.pm>

  #!perl
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  package Your::Library;

  1;

There isn't a lot of other boilerplate, because the default minter assumes that
you're going to go whole hog and use lots of plugins to build everything else
you might need.  (It doesn't I<add> those plugins to your F<dist.ini> for you,
though.  You'll have to do that yourself.)

=head2 Write some code and some tests

This bit is just like it would be with anything else: do the hard work that
will make releasing the dist worthwhile.  Dist::Zilla, sadly, will not write
your code or your code's tests for you.

You'll also want to write documentation, of course, but Dist::Zilla can help
make that less painful.  Choose an appropriate set of plugins, test, and
release!
